## 🎓 Study Tips

### When You're Stuck
1. Take a break (walk, coffee, etc.)
2. Explain the problem out loud
3. Draw a diagram
4. Test with smaller examples
5. Print variable values
6. Check your assumptions
7. Read error messages carefully
8. Ask your teacher (me!)

### Time Management
- Study in focused blocks (45-90 min)
- Take breaks (5-10 min)
- Don't code when tired
- It's okay to take days off
- Quality > Quantity

### Staying Motivated
- Remember why you started
- Celebrate small wins
- Don't compare to others
- Focus on understanding, not speed
- Every expert was once a beginner
- You're doing something hard - be proud!
